Our app functions as a personal calendar. Users have the option to create their own account. Once an account is created users can log in. Users are then meet with their calendar. Below the calendar is a dorm for users to submit more tasks to the calendar. When the user adds to this form, the task is added to the calendar.

From the calendar, users can edit or delete an event. When the user clicks on an event on the calendar, the event info pops up. Here the users can change info about the event, or they can delete it from the calendar. Each calendar and todo list is unique to each log in, and when a user logs in and logs out their tasks will be saved for their next login.

Instructions: 
To sign up click the create account button on the home screen. Enter user account info. Now you can login using the credentials you just entered.
To enter a task, type the description, title, and choose a date it needs to be done.
To delete a task click the task on the calendar and click the delete button.
To edit a task, change the text on the task information, and click save changes.

Challenges faced:
Our biggest problem was working together on the coding. It was hard to do individual stuff together then push to the main branch without problems. We ended up doing a lot o wokr on a single computer while we were all together.
